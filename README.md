# Grade-Calculator-TAMU
Calculates user's weighted grade within a class, as well as what they need to earn on the final exam in order to get an A/B/C/F.

For context, TAMU uses a service called eCampus to let faculty upload grades for students. When displaying grades to students, eCampus is
incredibly lacking. eCampus displays the overall grade in a class unweighted, which is misleading to class performance and causes hassle
for students when they try to find out what they need to score on a final exam.
